## Documentation of algorithms
You can find information about algorithms and technical considerations in the file `dql.pdf`.

## Algorithms
### DQN and Double DQN
You can access the implementation for double deep Q-Network (DDQN) in `ddqn.ipynb`.
### Prioritized-experience-replay Double DQN
You can access the implementation for DDQN with prioriztized experince replay in `pddqn.ipynb`.
### Dual Double DQN
You can access the implementation for the dual architecture in `dddqn.ipynb`
### Proximal Policy Optimization (policy gradient) 
You can access the implementation for the proximal policy optimization in `ppo.ipynb`
